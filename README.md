# hadfield-media-server

## Welcome
Welcome to the readme for the Hadfield media server project. After discovering the service Plex, I wanted to create a media server where I could host a collection of movies that would be easily accessable to friends and family. Although Plex is a good service, the user experience was lacking. In order to use the server users would have to create and account on their own, then give me their user so I could send them an invite, then accept the invite and remeber the server address. This process has way too many steps for users to actually want to do. Additionally, there was no good way for them to request new additions to the database of movies

## What is this project
In order to solve the above problems, working under the philosophy that the user is as lazy as possible, my goal was to create one of the most streamlined and effecient plex experiences possible. This site will automatically create a plex account, and invite it to the server. It automates movie torrenting and uses a custom search to find thousands of movies. Furthermore, it automates the 'closed' nature of the project with automatic account creation and approval pins.

## Future Plans
* Automatic WOL for Apple TV/ Roku/ non-browser clients
* Some sort of intro tour or something like that to increase new user retetion
* Google adsense or some other monitization strategy would be great
* Automatic downtime monitoring - text me when something bad happens
..* hadfield.webhop.me goes down
..* plex server goes down
..* mac pro goes down
..* new user is created/approved
..* stream or other errors
